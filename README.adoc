= OpenSignal
Public Information Limited (PIL)

OpenSignal is a container-native, transport-agnostic reference implementation for structured public intelligence events.

== What this demo does

. Generates a small set of canonical events
. Moves them through an in-memory transport (no external broker required)
. Applies a transparent enrichment rule (explainable scoring)
. Writes artifacts to the local `out/` directory:
* `events.ndjson`
* `daily-brief.adoc`

== Quick start

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up --build
----

== Notes

This repository is intentionally vendor-neutral.
Runtime transports and sinks can be added as optional plugins without changing the event contract.
