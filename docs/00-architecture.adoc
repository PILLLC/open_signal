= OpenSignal Architecture (Demo)

OpenSignal is designed to be transport-agnostic and sink-agnostic by contract.

== Core concepts

* *Event envelope:* A canonical event structure used everywhere in the system.
* *Transport:* An abstraction for moving events between components.
* *Sink:* An abstraction for persisting events to storage/analytics targets.
* *Rules:* Transparent enrichment and scoring logic with human-readable explanations.
* *Briefs:* Human-readable exports (AsciiDoc) generated from processed events.

== Demo wiring

* Transport: In-memory (single-process)
* Sink: NDJSON file output
* Brief: AsciiDoc summary export

This provides a runnable baseline that can later be extended to additional transports and sinks.
